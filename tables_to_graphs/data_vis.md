2. For your group's figure:
  - Understand and be ready to explain to the class what the figure is telling us.
  - Do you think the figure represents an improvement on the original table and is it using Gelman et al.'s principles?
  - Do you have any suggestions for how to display the original table in a graph? For example, would you consider a different graph or a different way to represent the information. If so, please draw it!
