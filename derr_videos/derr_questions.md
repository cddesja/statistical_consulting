### Discussion Questions

1. What were the guiding principles presented in Gelman, Pasarica, and Dodhia (2002)? Do you agree with them or have any suggestions.

2. For your groups Figure:
  - Understand and be ready to explain to the class what the Figure is telling us
  - Do you think it is an improvement on the original table and is it using Gelman et al.'s principles?
  - Do you have any suggestions for how to display the original table in a graph? For example, would you consider a different graph or a different way to represent the information. If so, please draw it!
